**Claude Code Instructions:**
Build this as a single-page React application with smooth scroll navigation. Use semantic HTML, ensure accessibility, and optimize for mobile. The design should be clean and modern with subtle animations. Prioritize fast load times and simple, maintainable code structure. Think "elevated simplicity" - professional landing page that makes a strong first impression without overwhelming the visitor.
